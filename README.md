# vrc-irlsync
Create a day/night cycle in your vrc world that automatically syncs with real world time

**Requirements**
1. A VrChat world project in Unity 2019.x.x
2. A skybox shader that has a day/night cycle dependant on a directional light in your scene. Personally, I use RED_SIM's Beautiful Sky Shader which can be found here. https://www.patreon.com/posts/beautiful-sky-35667377

**Process**
Apply the 3 scripts to a directional light in your scene and adjust the values accordingly.
